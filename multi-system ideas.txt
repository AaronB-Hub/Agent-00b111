Multi-system theory/model for human brains:
- System 1 is fast but kinda dumb
- System 2 is slow but smart


Think that this would be a very useful template for models
Potential systems:
- Reinforcement learning (RL)
- Attention-based token-prediction model (LLM)
- Database lookup (DB)


RL ideas:
- NEAT?


LLM ideas:
- Use input strings as tokens
- No input frames like spaces? Seem different in that space tokens are always the same length.
-- May need a break token for longer pauses and control the length some other way?


DB ideas:
- Clear separation of fact versus theory entries?
-- Or all the same type and just has a confidenece value?
- Needs an entry generation system
-- Editable
- Entries solidify with time and confirmation
-- Need a way to revise with enough evidence
