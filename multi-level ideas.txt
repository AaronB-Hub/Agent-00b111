Flow:
1. Perception (get current state of system)
2. Analysis (get Desired state of system)
3. Planning (decide actions to change system state)
4. Execution (perform actions)


Behaviors
  - scope of complexity?
    -- Smallest is 1 state change (overall state with all values, not necessarily a playerâ€™s state)?
    -- Or smallest is 1 input change?




Cognition levels:
- Vision
- Goals
- Tasks
- Actions
- Execution

Reinforcement-learned AI can be converted to transformer AI for simple bot opponents in games

Can think of different levels in terms of state. Current versus desired state, how many intermediate states, states to avoid, etc.
