Flow:
1. perception (get current state of system)
2. Analysis (get Desired state of system)
3. Planning (decide actions to change system state)
4. Execution (perform actions)


Behaviors
  - scope of complexity?
    -- Smallest is 1 state change (overall state with all values, not necessarily a playerâ€™s state)?
    -- Or smallest is 1 input change?
