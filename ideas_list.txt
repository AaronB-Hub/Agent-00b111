- Make helper functions to create more useful inputs than just what game gives you

- Give higher-level networks the ability to dynamically choose inputs to lower-level networks (or maybe weight them down/up instead of on/off)
  -> This could include selecting helper functions or making changes to them dynamically for a different input based on system conditions

- Weight "sets" that can be swapped in to utilize the same network for different scenarios
  -> Is there actually any reason to do this? Is this the same resource-wise as two networks?
